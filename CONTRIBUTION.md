# CONTRIBUTING
If you contribute to the codebase, please try to keep to the following principles:

## COMMANDS
- Commands should only contain input validation, response output, and any other conditional logic. Any work with data should be handled largely by the models
- Commands should have their outputs as string constants, that way the constants can easily be used for test cases
